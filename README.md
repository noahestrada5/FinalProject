# FinalProject
For my final project in web mapping at App State, I highlighted [popular rafting outfitters](https://www.colorado.com/activities/colorado-rafting) and notable locations to receive [swiftwater education](https://americancanoe.org/education/take-a-paddling-class/course-calendar/) within the state of Colorado. I also used an open source data set from [Open Water Foundation](https://openwaterfoundation.org/)  to display the variety of streams that can be found in the state. The primary objective of this map was to briefly showcase the whitewater opportunities that Colorado has to offer for tourists. The inspiration for this map came from the first article I had provided a url for above. I would argue that my map supports the article’s reference to rafting outfitters and training locations as it provides immediate spatial reference for a visitor to use in planning, as they are likely unfamiliar with the area. I feel mostly happy about the turnout of the map. It certainly appears to be made by a beginner in web cartography, but I don’t think that holds it back from serving its initial purpose and providing everything the user needs to know. There are a few things I would change with more time and guidance. Using mouseover features rather than popups is the first thing that comes to mind. It arguably makes the map easier to navigate and work with. I do, however, like the simplicity of popups. I also would like to use a different basemap. The current map appears very “white,” which comes off as plan and almost uninteresting for a user.
